## Top 3 Apps:

 ### 1.Rudio (Running Audio)
   - **Description:** Audio book app for runners where different genre audio books will be played as they pass different different places in their neighborhood. 
   - **Category:** Fitness 
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is important because runners prefer to only carry their phones while exercising. Therefore, because this app caters to runners, we have no choice but to be mobile. 
   - **Story:** Makes the jogging more productive because runners can now exercise and enjoy great stories at the same time. Instead of listening to booksand running at two seperate times, our users can now do both simultaneously. 
   - **Market:** All runners across the world. 
   - **Habit:** Runners will use this each time they run. For many people this will be daily, for some it will be less frequent. 
   - **Scope:** V1 will not allow runners to see which genres are popular in which parts of their neighborhood. They will simply recieve a notification that they are entering an area with a new genre. V2 will allow users to see which areas specialize in which genres, so they can plan where they will run to listen to the stories they would like to hear.

 ### 2. VideoUnited
   - **Description:** Our app is a database of all movies, drama, music, books, food, etc.that every member can share their interests to those by providing rating, comments, add as favorites, mark as watched/ read/ tried, etc. People from all over the world can share what they like and don't like, make friends with people with the similar interests. Our app can also cooperate with other business to recommend new ideas to people with particular interests, as well as discounted prices for them.

   - **Mobile:** It is convenient for people to mark a "like" to the food they just enjoyed, or a movie they just watched with their friends.

   - **Scope:** Members are not only recommended to provide ratings and comments, they can also add items to our database.Members who give really good comments many times can also be marked as movie experts, etc - we can create titles for them or let them create some. There are many fun things we can develop.
